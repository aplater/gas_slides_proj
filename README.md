# gas_slides_proj
self-contained Google Apps Script code to mass customize Google Slides files according to a list of details in a Google Sheet. 

Did this quick script to optimize the contacting of multiple companies for sponsorship proposals for my CCA committee work. 

Script refers to a Google Sheet for the names of the companies, and makes copies of a Google Slides template, changing the filename and the elements in the title slide to customize it for mail merging.
